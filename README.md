# Bottango Rest API Playback Controller

# About

This app lets you wirelessly play, pause, and scrub through animations on Bottango with its REST API. It makes controlling animatronics over your local network super easy, whether you’re fine-tuning playback or jumping around in complicated animation sequences. Plus, it’s completely open-source, so you can tweak it however you want! Just a heads-up, though—I’m not the best at leaving comments in the code, so good luck figuring that part out. If you make something with it or add something to it let me know I’d love to see what you create.

# So, what’s Bottango? 

It’s this awesome software that lets you animate servos, steppers, lights, and pneumatics using your PC alongside an Arduino or an ESP-32. It has REST API support, which means you can easily play and pause animations and do a bunch of other cool stuff wirelessly.
